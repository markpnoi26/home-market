# See https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files for more about ignoring files.
#
# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'

# Ignore bundler config.
home-market-backend/.bundle

# Ignore the default SQLite database.
home-market-backend/db/*.sqlite3
home-market-backend/db/*.sqlite3-journal
home-market-backend/db/*.sqlite3-*

# Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.
home-market-backend/log/*
home-market-backend/tmp/*
# !/log/.keep
# !/tmp/.keep

# Ignore uploaded files in development.
home-market-backend/storage/*
# !/storage/.keep
# .byebug_history

# Ignore master key for decrypting credentials and more.
home-market-backend/config/master.key
